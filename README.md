# mattstack

This script builds and installs Openstack Kilo release on Ubuntu 14.04 server (Trusty).
It was created as devstack does not persist during reboots, so I wanted a quick way to deploy Openstack. 

It's basically a scripted version of this:
http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/install/apt/content/index.html

With some amendments to fix issues I found following that guide.
